# Kickstarting with Excel

Data analysis project using Excel to analyze crowd-fund campaigns.  

## Overview of Project

Louise wants to fund her theater play, Fever, in Kickstarter. She plans to ask for over 10Â´000 dollars. In this project we are going to analyze other funding campaigns of Kickstarter. The goal is to look at the characteristics of other successful campaigns and make recommendations to Louise, to make it more possible for her to meet her goal.


### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to get insight of the Kickstarter campaigns that are successful. Based on that we can advise Louise about the best time of the year to make a campaign and which are the funding goals that can be achieved more easily.  

## Analysis and Challenges

For this analysis we had a total of 4114 projects that had a fund-raising campaign in Kickstarter. From there we selected the theater plays to get more information about them. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To make the analysis of outcomes based on launch date the pivot tables were very useful. To apply different types of filters and rapidly graph them was very powerful and time saving. 
In the chart we can se that the best months to launch a campaign are May, June and July. Not recommended the months of October, November and December.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In the analysis of outcomes based on goals we did a graph of distribution of the total number of successful and other of failed campaigns. The distribution has positive skew in both cases. The tail was difficult to analyze because of the little number of values there

The percentage of outcomes based on goal was very useful to analyze the data in the long positive tails. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One challenge in this project was the amount of data involved. This is where the advanced functions of Excel helped us to filter the data. 
Another great tool we used was the graphs of pivot tables. Once the data was filtered being able to graph it right away was very useful. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The highest number of successful theater outcomes based on Launch date are between May, June and July. This is the best time for Louise to start her campaign.

The worst moment for a campaign in this case is between October and December, the failed rate is high and successful rate is low. For December is almost the same the failed and the successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The group of projects with a goal between 1000 and 4999 dollars was the one with more successful campaigns 388 and also the second highest rate of success with 73%. 
Louise campaign group has a percentage of success of 54%, but the goal range below only of 55%, there would be not much gain statistically to be in that range.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

As limitations of this dataset, we can mention that is only one source of information. It would be desirable if we can complement this dataset with other companies or governmental agencies. 

The successful and failed campaigns data has a long positive tail, positive skew. And the first group is smaller than the rest, of less than 1000 of width.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

A very useful chart we can make with this data is the number of successful campaigns of the theater category. We can see here that this data has a positive skew in the distribution. 
Also, the total number of failed campaigns, from the graphs we determine that they have a very similar distribution shape.
